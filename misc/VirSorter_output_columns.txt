VirSorter main output columns:

Column:												Content:
Contig_id											Name of contigs from input fasta file. Has the prefix "VIRsorter_"
Nb.genes.contigs									Number of genes on contig
Fragment											Name of fragments where putative prophages were found. Same as "Contig_id" but with suffix of gene range "-gene_XXX-gene_XXX"
Nb.genes											Number of genes present on gene fragment
Category											Value (1-3) that shows confidence of prediction. 1 = "pretty sure", 2 = "quite sure", 3 = "not so sure"
Nb.phage.hallmark.genes								Number of hallmark viral genes
